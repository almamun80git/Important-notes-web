only notes file here, tips and tricks, how to do it.
It seems like you want to prepare for job-related interviews. Here are some key steps to get ready for technical interviews:

- **Practice Coding**: Use platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) to practice coding problems.
- **Understand Data Structures and Algorithms**: Review and practice common data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching).
- **System Design**: Study and practice system design questions, which are common in senior-level interviews.
- **Mock Interviews**: Conduct mock interviews with peers or use platforms like [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) or [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/).
- **Behavioral Questions**: Prepare for behavioral questions by using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.
- **Review Job-Specific Skills**: If applying for a specific role, review the key technologies and skills required for that role.

If you have any specific questions or need help with coding problems or GitHub-related topics, feel free to ask!
